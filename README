PrivCoin

A debian-live based linux distribution to do bitcoin transactions.


Features:
* Additional Privacy-Kernel included: Disables access to hdd and network
* Bitcoin QT and Armory included (both compiled from source)
* Virtualbox included (to facilitate migration of wallets from VM-Setups)
* "Fresh" Operating System after each boot
* Integrity protected by encrypted checksums of all relevant files
* Based on debian-live (http://live.debian.net): Easily extendable and customizable


Getting Started:
You will need a VM with Debian Wheezy (amd64 preferred, other architectures are untested and you have to change config.sh accordingly).

Then do the following:
aptitude install live-builder
git clone https://github.com/flipperfish/privcoin.git
cd privcoin
lb config
sudo lb build

During the build you will be asked for a password. With this password the integrity of your live-system can be verified. It does NOT encrypt the live-system, only integrity is protected.
After the build, there will be a file "binary.hybrid.iso" in the root of the repository.
This can be burnt to cd or written to flash-drive by using dd (Linux) or UNetbootin (Windows).

You can tweak some options in config.sh:
* BUILD_FOR_CD: If set to false, live-boot-scripts will be patched to mount the live-medium writable (not the root-filesystem, this is squashfs anyways!). As side-effect the image can not run from cd anymore.
* NO_VIRTUALBOX: Leave out virtualbox-packages to save space in the resulting image.
